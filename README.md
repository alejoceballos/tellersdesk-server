# Tellers' Desk

A study case system used to learn a set of Web Technologies (Javascript/ES6/Ember.js, CSS/SASS, Node.js/Express and MongoDB). The system is another attempt to create a **Storytelling RPG** manager (for the former "New World of Darkness - **nWoD**", now "Chronicles of Darkness - **CofD**") to aid storytellers around the world.

For more information regarding Storytelling and nWoD/CofD, check <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Wolf_Publishing> or <http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/>. 

### To make a long story short...

The main idea is to allow a storyteller and its fellow players to manage story tables and characters sheets in one system. Basically one story may allow one or more characters to interact with each other.  

#### Example:
```
.
├── Story
│   └── Character
│       ├── Attribute
│       ├── Skill
.       .
.       .
.       .
```

#### System milestones are:
1. Characters management:
2. Story management:
3. Security

For example:
- An admin can do anything, also is the only one that can create users;
- A Storyteller can create stories, NPCs and associate characters to the stories;
- A Player can only create characters;
- Other requirements:
  - While in a story, a player cannot update its character. Only the Storyteller responsible for the story is allowed to do it;

# Setup
